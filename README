Meshwork allows you to create a private virtual network of friends that you
can use to chat, share files, and more without worrying about compromising
your privacy.

Meshwork was created by Eric Butler.

Meshwork is currently an abandoned project. Some things work, some things don't.
If you're interested in the project, please contact me (eric@extremeboredom.net).
I'd be happy to chat about it.

Instructions
------------

First install all build dependencies as explained above.

If you are building from a git repository:

	./autogen.sh

Otherwise if you are building from a release tarball:

	./configure

Next run:

Then just type 'meshwork' to start it.

If you would rather not install Meshwork, you can run it out
of the source tree:

Have fun.
