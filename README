About
-----

Meshwork allows you to create a private virtual network of friends that you
can use to chat, share files, and more without worrying about compromising
your privacy.

Meshwork was created by Eric Butler.

Meshwork is currently an abandoned project. Some things work, some things don't.
If you're interested in the project, please contact me (eric@extremeboredom.net).
I'd be happy to chat about it.
